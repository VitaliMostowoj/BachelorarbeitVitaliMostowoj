\chapter*{Abstract}
The company \ac{p+f} is a leading manufacturer of industrial safety equipment in the field of process automation. The product portfolio includes a range of industrial computer systems for use in explosion-proof areas. Due to their use in industrial environments, these systems are exposed to environmental influences such as solar radiation or vibrations. An incorrect assessment of these environmental influences can result in harmful and unacceptable operations. Often these operations cannot be perceived. To counteract this problem, the sensor technology installed in the systems is to be used to indicate just such operations.\\
The first part of this thesis deals with the development of a concept and an architecture for such a health monitoring solution for the \acl{p+f} \ac{hmi} platforms. Thereby, an architecture is created, which allows platform-independent reading and storing of sensor values. Furthermore, a model for the state evaluation of the platforms is defined.
In the second part of this thesis a prototype of the application is implemented. It reads sensors of the platforms, evaluates the state of the device based on the read data and provides the data to a network interface.
For the visualization of the data a dashboard is created, which is provided decentralized on a separate computer. In this dashboard, sensor data from the platforms can be retrieved in real time.
